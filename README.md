Vision based transformers

Vision-Based Transformers (ViTs) revolutionize image processing by leveraging the Transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, to handle visual data. Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical convolutional layers, ViTs divide input images into fixed-size patches and process them using self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships. This approach enables ViTs to efficiently handle images of variable size and resolution, offering scalability and flexibility. While ViTs have shown promising results in image classification tasks, further research is needed to fully explore their potential compared to traditional CNN-based models.


MATH problem 

1.When comparing distances between different paths in a 2D grid of constrained straight interlocking paths, the most suitable metric is the Manhattan distance. This metric accurately reflects the constrained movement within the grid by measuring the minimum number of steps required to traverse from one point to another along horizontal and vertical directions. It is computationally efficient and directly corresponds to the true path length within the grid. Alternative metrics such as the Euclidean distance, Chebyshev distance, and Hamming distance may have their own applications, but they do not align as well with the constrained nature of the paths in the grid. Therefore, the Manhattan distance emerges as the optimal choice for comparing distances between paths in this scenario.



2.The common criterion used to define the "likeliness" between any two words mathematically is known as similarity or distance. This criterion quantitatively measures the resemblance or difference between two words based on various factors such as their spelling, pronunciation, meaning, or context.
