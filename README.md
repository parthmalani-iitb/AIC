Vision based transformers

Vision-Based Transformers (ViTs) revolutionize image processing by leveraging the Transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, to handle visual data. Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical convolutional layers, ViTs divide input images into fixed-size patches and process them using self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships. This approach enables ViTs to efficiently handle images of variable size and resolution, offering scalability and flexibility. While ViTs have shown promising results in image classification tasks, further research is needed to fully explore their potential compared to traditional CNN-based models.
