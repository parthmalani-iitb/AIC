Hi, my name is Parth Malani, a freshman (to be a sophomore) at IIT Bombay. I have a keen interest to learn more about the Artificial Intelligence world. And my curiosity is increasing day by day. I’m also aspiring to be a UGAC Club convenor. I have also taken SOS and am allotted an AI-ML project and I have also registered for SOS . Right now I’m learning ML , Deep Learning and DSA from coursera. I know python, java, c++ and a little bit of ML.


I am eager to join the AI Community of IITB as a junior engineer . I was always curious about Artificial Intelligence and by joining this community I will be able to satisfy my curiosity and dive deeper into AI and solve real world problems.
I have already started learning about ML but not enough to build something but I'm learning about it more . I have learned many things from the Assignments, although I have faced many difficulties,I have overcome them by visiting many forums, mainly stackoverflow and pytorch forums, by using chat gpt,copilot and by watching random videos.
I know that to be a junior engineer in the AI community requires a lot of effort and knowledge about AI and right now I don't know much about AI but I’m very enthusiastic about this community and I pledge to complete the tasks on time because I will get to learn more about AI by contributing to the community.



I hope that you will give me this opportunity to become a junior engineer and I will obtain enough knowledge to pursue and master AI and ML and hopefully in future  transfer the knowledge to my juniors.


Thank you.
